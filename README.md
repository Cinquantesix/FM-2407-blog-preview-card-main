## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learn a know kind of value for ```width:```, ```fit-content```. Thank [@gmagnenat](https://github.com/gmagnenat) for that. I didn't know the child will take all the width in a flex column…

### Continued development

I really liked the way of thinking that I don't need ```@media (…) {…}``` to be 100% responsive. That will be really helpful for next projects.

### Useful resources

- [@fontface](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/css3_pr_font-face_rule.php) - If your are like me an you always forgot how to link fonts…
